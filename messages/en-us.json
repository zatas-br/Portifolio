    "history": [
      "Zatas' journey began when a personal trainer, recommended by other programmers, contacted one of the partners, Bruno, looking for a way to optimize his student management. With this proposal in hand, Bruno invited Gabriel and Antony to collaborate on the application's development.",
      "The project was a success and showed the team the power of collaboration. To complement the group's technical skills, Bryan was invited to the partnership, bringing his expertise in marketing and design.",
      "Zatas was founded on this foundation: the union of diverse skills with the purpose of offering complete solutions. The company started by solving a specific problem and today continues with the same passion for turning each client's challenges into successful projects.",
      "The Meaning of 'Zatas'",
      "The name 'Zatas' was chosen for its strong and memorable sound. It refers to the word 'exact', reflecting the essence of the company's work: the search for precision, logic, and data intelligence in the construction of each solution. Zatas is synonymous with the exact solution for each client's challenge."
