      "Zatas was founded on this foundation: the union of diverse skills with the purpose of offering complete solutions. The company started by solving a specific problem and today continues with the same passion for turning each client's challenges into successful projects.",
      "The Meaning of 'Zatas'",

It refers to the word 'exact', reflecting the essence of the company's work: the search for precision, logic, and data intelligence in the construction of each solution.
